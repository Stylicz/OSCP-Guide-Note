#### This is just a Guide Note based on my experience during the OSCP+ exam

> Hope this will help you to avoid a mistake during your exam.

- Set the computer to non-sleep mode to keep all sessions active.
- Backup your Kali before updating and taking the exam.
- Take autosaves and full screenshots of every output result.
- Avoid clearing the Terminal, just launch a new one if you need a clean Terminal.
- Keep Kali running until the report is finished.
- If you are out of ideas, take a break and refresh yourself.
- Set an alarm if you plan to take a long rest.
- Consider using `pwd && whoami && ipconfig && cat proof`. According to OffSec requirements, proof files must come from their original location.
- Write as much detail as possible in the report.
- Draft a brief report before the full report, it helps identify missing information but takes extra time.
- Believe in yourselfâ€”you can do it!
